Capital Bikeshare Station Predictability Analysis Report
  Number of stations analyzed: 278
  Stations with valid results: 278
  Stations failed: 0
  Model: Prophet with weather regressors
  Seasonality: Yearly + Weekly (multiplicative)

[WEATHER REGRESSORS USED]
  - temp_mean: Daily mean temperature (°C)
  - temp_squared: Temperature squared (captures non-linear effect)
  - precipitation: Daily precipitation (mm)

[MODEL RATIONALE]
  The model uses only scientifically justified features:
  - Prophet automatically captures weekly and yearly seasonality
  - Temperature has an inverted U-shape effect on biking
    (both too cold and too hot reduce ridership)
  - Precipitation directly discourages biking
  No event-specific features (holidays, festivals) are included
  to maintain model generalizability and interpretability.
